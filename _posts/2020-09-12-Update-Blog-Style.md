After looking at the blog I had created, I decided I need to enable some form of search function in order for me to trawl through my posts.

Recall that my primary aim of the blog is to consolidate my learning frustrations for ease of future reference. The last thing I would need is to be frustrated again at being unable to find the info I need.

As such, I looked around and decided to use the [MinimalMistakes] theme because there are search functions built in.

The documentation was good as it guided me through all possible configuration changes available to me. One thing to caution is to always have a backup copy of the last successful built such that you do not need to rebuild if something goes wrong.

Here I am attempting to link to a video of my favourite YouTube show.
