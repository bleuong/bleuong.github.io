In my midst of checking for tips on how to improve formatting for my blog, I cam across this [cheat sheet].

From that cheat sheet, i actually found a [listing] of the emojis which can used. :smirk: Just remember to update both your _config.yml and Gemfile to include the plugin **jemoji**.

So today, I am tempted to try to post images on my blog: my favourite football club Liverpool.
