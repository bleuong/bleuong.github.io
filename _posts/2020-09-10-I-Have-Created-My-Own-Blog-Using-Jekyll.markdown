After trying to learn Data Science for a while, I realise I was not getting anywhere. My notes are in a mess and learning is not very structured. So I have decided to follow the advice from YouTuber [Python Programmer] to have a blog as a means to motivate myself in this learning journey.

I also hope to document my learning for my future reference, and maybe it would help you in your own journey.

For this blog, I followed the instructions from [Onextrapixel] and build it within an hour on my local machine.

The last part of the instruction require Git which I initially tried using [Git-SCM]. The difficult part was trying to figure out why the website was loaded but did not load at Github Pages.

In the end, I use [Git Desktop] and figured it was much easier to push to the repositary without changing the contents of my files. I had spent about 5 hours trying different combinations to get the page up and running.

Finally, I am done at 0444H in the morning.
